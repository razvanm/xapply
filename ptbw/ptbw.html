<h1>What you need to know to understand this document</h1>

This document assumes you are quite familiar with the
standard UNIX process model
and the shell <code class="sh">sh</code>(1).
In addition you should have a working understanding of the
<a href="../../bin/xapply/xapply.html"><code class="sh">xapply</code></a>(1)
wrapper.

<h1>What is <code class="sh">ptbw</code>?</h1>

The <code class="sh">ptbw</code> <a href="../../bin/wrapw/wrapper.html">wrapper</a> is a governor for
large parallel tasks.
Without a limiter many parallel processes would consume more
resources than the underlying system can provide.
This conflict may "thrash" the node, starve it for resources, or
cause competing tasks to double allocate an asset.

<p>
<code class="sh">Ptbw</code> provides cooperating processes a pool of
resources in a structure that allows them to be locked and
released very quickly.
A managing instance of <code class="sh">ptbw</code> controls the free pool,
each client instance allocates from that pool on behalf of a
<code class="param">client</code> process.
When a <code class="param">client</code> process
<code class="libc">exit</code>s the resources are returned to
the free poll.

<h2>Wrapper mode</h2>

Because <code class="sh">ptbw</code> is a wrapper it has two modes: the
manager and client.
See the <A href="/cgi-bin/manpage.cgi?ptbw">ptbw manual page</A> for
more details on these modes.

In manager mode, under the <code class="opt">-m</code> option,
<code class="sh">ptbw</code> starts a process in
an environment that allows it to
allocate resources from a pool.
That process (given as <code class="param">utility</code> below)
usually starts parallel tasks which allocate elements from the
pool to do work.
That usage looks like:
<blockquote>
ptbw
<code class="opt">-m</code>
[<code class="opt">-dqQ</code>]
[<code class="opt">-</code><code class="param">depth</code>]
[<code class="opt">-J</code> <code class="param">jobs</code>]
[<code class="opt">-N</code> <code class="param">path</code>]
[<code class="opt">-R</code> <code class="param">req</code>]
[<code class="opt">-t</code> <code class="param">tags</code>]
[<code class="param">utility</code>]
</blockquote>

<P>
Then each <code class="param">client</code> process started
directly or indirectly by <code class="param">utility</code>
requests resources from the pool then executes with an
environment variable, named <code class="sh">ptbw_list</code>, set to
indicate while elements of the pool were bound for that
task.
That usage looks like:
<blockquote>
ptbw
[<code class="opt">-AqQ</code>]
[<code class="opt">-</code><code class="param">depth</code>]
[<code class="opt">-R</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">req</code>]
[<code class="opt">-t</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">tags</code>]
[<code class="param">client</code>]
</blockquote>

<h2>As an example</h2>

Physical resources are a good first example, for instance an out-bound modem.
Modems are a fixed asset, as they are
each connected to a telephone line.  There are a fixed number of modems
connected to a server, so a process that needs access to a modem must
lock that modem to insure that another process is not presently
engaging it.

<p>
Assume there are 3 modems connected to our server, and that we need to
dial 150 hosts to gather some data from each.
The usual method to split the work would evenly divide
the hosts to create a list of 50 hosts for each dialer process.  By doing
that we are assuming that each data recovery task takes the same amount
of time.
<p>
Another way would be to start 150 processes and spin-lock for a modem in
each.  That's exactly how some of the low-level UNIX kernel events work,
which is fine for a small set of threads spinning for a diverse resource
pool -- not so much for user-level tasks that should be better coordinated.
<p>
The method implemented by <code class="sh">ptbw</code> wraps an environment in
which access to a modem is granted to a tree for the life of
the root process in that tree.  As modems become available a
process is fork'd bound to that resource, as each task finishes
it exits to return the modem to the pool.

<p>
Of course a "modem" could represent any virtural or physical resource.

<h2>The master interface</h2>

The resource manager is the master in the wrapper model.  This process
services clients as they request access to tokens from the resource pool,
provides notification of available resources to blocked clients, and
waits for the <code class="param">utility</code> process to exit.

<p id="opt-N">
Normally clients use the diversion stack managed in
the environment to connect to the
tightest enclosing master instance.
But in the case of <code class="sh">ptbw</code>
it is sometimes more effective to
have a "global" instance rooted at a well-known socket to
manage system-wide pools.  In that case the global instance
sets the desired socket name with
<code class="opt">-N</code> <code class="param">path</code>.
This allows disparate clients to cooperate via the "fixed"
address of the global instance.

<p>
The <code class="param">path</code> selected is only really fixed by
a site (or application) policy, not something you need to
get consensus on across the IETF, or even across the street.

<p id="opt-t">
Any master instance must draw the list of tokens from someplace.
The non-comment lines from the <code class="param">tags</code> file
specified under <code class="opt">-t</code> form the resource
pool for most instances.  This allows comments for revision control
markup to be included in the file.
For example a <code class="param">tags</code> file describing
our three working modems might look like:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code ># $<!-- -->Source: <i>revision control path...</i>
/dev/cua01
/dev/cua02
#/dev/cua03
/dev/cua04</code></pre></blockquote>
The two commented lines help keep track of the authoritive data source,
and the fact that modem 3 is out of service.
But the reason why modem 3 is out of service is in the
revision log of the file, not in the file itself.
<code class="sh">Hxmd</code> configuration files accept comments
for the same reason.

<p id="master1">
Feel free to copy that file to "example.list", being careful to trim
any blanks on the end of the lines.
To turn that file into a running instance of <code class="sh">ptbw</code>
one might execute:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -m -t example.list ${SHELL} -i</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
By using the shell as the <code class="param">utility</code> we can explore the
wrapper environment we've created.  Try a few commands from within
that shell, for starters the normal version option:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -V</code></pre></blockquote>
Note that there is an additional line at the end of the output
that shows the active diversion and the fact that it is the
default target:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw:  1: /tmp/ptbdPbdWRT/sta0 [target]</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now we can ask for the whole tableau:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw</code></pre></blockquote>
Which outputs:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw: master has 3 tokens, max length 10 (total space 33)
 Master tokens from file: example.list
 Index  Lock    Tokens (request in groups of 1)
     0  0       /dev/cua01
     1  0       /dev/cua02
     2  0       /dev/cua04</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
If we were to lock a token with the client program, then look at the
tableau before the process releases the lock:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw sleep 1024 &amp;
ptbw</code></pre></blockquote>
We could even see the process-id of
the <code class="sh">ptbw</code> instance with the lock.
You can use that process-id to shoot your own processes, but don't
believe it if you are the superuser.  In fact I almost never run
a <code class="sh">ptbw</code> as root, there is no reason to.

<p>
Either foreground and terminate the sleepers, or kill them by pid
before you move on.

<p>
The <code class="param">tags</code> file may also be the name
of a master instance's socket.  In that case the new master allocates
resources from the (now) enclosing master, manages them, then returns
them to the spcified master instance.  That is one way a "global"
master might be leveraged to share resources amongst unrelated
tasks.  The <code class="param">tags</code> filename "-" is
a synonym for the tightest diversion's socket name.

<P>
Still under the <code class="sh">ptbw</code> from above.  We can
start another master instance inside the first, just run:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >PS1="below " ptbw -m -J2 -R1 -t - ${SHELL} -i</code></pre></blockquote>
then run the same test you run above.  Now the version output shows
two enclosing diversions, and the tableau has only 2 lines.

<P>
If you exit the "below" shell and start another, then look in
the tableau output you might notice that the tokens the nested
instance has to manage changed.  By default <code class="sh">ptbw</code>
rolls though the tokens, it doesn't always give out the first available.

<P>
Feel free to exit those master shells.

<p id="opt-R">
Clients can allocate as many resources as they wish, but can only
ask for <code class="param">req</code> of them in an atomic transaction.
Any request for more than that many tokens might be processed as
more than one allocation.  This gives competing processes as chance to
"get in the game" before the big dog consumes all the choice tokens.
The <code class="opt">-R</code> specification to the master should be
tuned to match the clients minimal needs.  A value of 1 is usually
a good default, or don't specify any.

<p id="opt-J">
When constrained by a <code class="param">tags</code> the
<code class="param">jobs</code> specification has little effect:
we can't add more tokens to the resource pool just because the command-line
asked for more.  But in cases where we are drawing from an enclosing
instance or creating a list, we can use <code class="opt">-J</code>
and <code class="opt">-R</code> to specify how many tokens to allocate
for maximum through-put.

<p>
For example to display a tableau with an allocation of 20 integers
and an atomic allocation limit of 4 at a time:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -m -J5 -R4 -- ptbw</code></pre></blockquote>
Which outputs a tableau which looks like:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw: master has 20 tokens, max length 2 (total space 50)
 Master tokens from the internal function: iota
 Index	Lock	Tokens (request in groups of 4)
     0	0	0
     1	0	1
     2	0	2
     3	0	3
     4	0	4
     5	0	5
     6	0	6
     7	0	7
     8	0	8
     9	0	9
    10	0	10
    11	0	11
    12	0	12
    13	0	13
    14	0	14
    15	0	15
    16	0	16
    17	0	17
    18	0	18
    19	0	19</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
That same command, when passed a <code class="opt">-t</code> option with
a file that holds fewer than 20 tokens, produces an error like:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw: token count 11 less than suggested (20)</code></pre></blockquote>
This error can be suppressed with <code class="opt">-q</code>.


<h2 id="client">The client interface</h2>

<p id="tableau">
In the example above we used <code class="sh">ptbw</code> as the
<code class="param">client</code> to output the tableau.  That is the
default behavior when no client shell command is specified on the
command-line.

<p id="ptbw_list">
When a shell command is executed from a client instance of
<code class="sh">ptbw</code> it may accept the tokens allocated on its
behalf in two ways.  Either as an environment variable, or
as positional parameters to <code class="param">client</code>.

<P>
By default the environment variable <code class="env">ptbw_list</code>
holds the recovered values (separated with newlines).  He is an example
of a client that just calls <code class="sh">echo</code>:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -R2 sh -c 'echo $ptbw_list'</code></pre></blockquote>
Run from a shell that should output:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw: no enclosing diversion</code></pre></blockquote>

<p id="opt-V">
To make an enclosing diversion you need to start another shell wrapped in
a <code class="sh">ptbw</code>:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -m -R2 -J3 $SHELL -i</code></pre></blockquote>
In that shell I might set the prompt to indicate that it is not your
login shell, for example set <code class="env">PS1</code> to some unique
string.  You can check to see if you are in such as above.
<p>
In that output notice the line with the "[target]" tag on the end, that
is the current selected diversion.
When there is no diversion in the list, there are no enclosing diversions.
All wrappers should have about that same display in the version output, for
example see
<A href="../xclate/xclate.html"><code class="sh">xclate</code></A>.

<p>
From within that shell retry the <code class="sh">echo</code> client:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -R2 sh -c 'echo $ptbw_list'</code></pre></blockquote>
Run from a shell that should output:
<code class="file">0 1</code> then
<code class="file">2 3</code> then
<code class="file">4 5</code> then repeat that sequence as
long as you like.

<p id="opt-A">
The indirection through a shell (via <code class="sh">sh -c</code>) is
a little cumbersome.  We need that to expand the environment variable
set by <code class="sh">ptbw</code>.  We can eliminate that by moving
the tokens to the command line with the <code class="opt">-A</code>
option.  This option appends the tokens to the end of the argument
vector for the <code class="param">client</code> command, so the
above example becomes:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -R2 -A echo</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
When calling a shell script that takes the tokens as
positional parameters (on the end of the argument list) the
<code class="sh">-A</code> form is much better.
Use the environment form when the program that
consumes the tokens is not the direct client, that is
don't use a shell to set an environment variable if you don't need
the shell at all.

<h2>A persistant instance</h2>

Moving our attention back to the master aspect of the wrapper,
what <code class="param">utility</code> would a
a "global" instance select?  The processes that the global
instance serves are not descendent from that process, they
locate the service by a well-known socket name, not by an
inherrited environment.  So there is no clear process in
which to <code class="lib">wait</code>.

<p>
The special name "<code class="opt">:</code>" (a colon) denotes
a <code class="param">utility</code> that blocks until the
process is explicitly shutdown.  An instance started with this
feature is called a "persistant instance".

<p id="opt-Q">
There are two ways to stop a persistant instance.  One way is
to send the process a <code class="markup">TERM</code> signal.
The other is the start a client with the
<code class="opt">-Q</code> option: when that client disconnects from
the master it gracefully shuts itself down.

<P>
To try that start a detached instance with (I'm assuming the
environment variable <code class="env">USER</code> is set to your login name):
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -m -R2 -J3 -N /tmp/$USER.ptbw : &amp;</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
Then repeat the command below to output pairs of tokens from that instance:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -t /tmp/$USER.ptbw -A -R2 echo</code></pre></blockquote>

<P>
After running this command to terminate the background instance:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -Q -t /tmp/$USER.ptbw -R0 true</code></pre></blockquote>
you should get notification that the background process terminated.
Repeat that experiment with a client that stalls for a bit, say 15 seconds:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >ptbw -t /tmp/$USER.ptbw -R2 sleep 15 &amp;</code></pre></blockquote>
then ask the master to exit, and it will not exit until the client
does.  This is actually quite a feature.

<h2 id="detached">Detached instances</h2>

<p id="opt-d">
The basic wrapper tactic includes detached diversions, that is diversions
that don't modify the stack environment.  <code class="sh">Ptbw</code>
implements this with the standard <code class="opt">-d</code> command-line
option.

<p>
A detached diversion publishes the client socket in
the environement variable <code class="env">ptbw_d</code>.
This is used as a <code class="param">tags</code> specification under
<code class="opt">-t</code> in a client instance to directly
address the detached diversion.  The value could be record in a
file, or send to another process through any of the many UNIX
<acronym title="inter-process comunications">IPC</acronym>
facilities.

<p>
The value of <code class="env">ptbw_d</code> must be recovered
and recorded by <code class="param">client</code> directly, as
it may be used by any other program that needs a detached diversion of
<code class="sh">ptbw</code>.
In other words the variable doesn't need to be preserved by
any service that needs a detached instance, but it may be
preserved.
It is considered good form to preserve any detached names if
it is not a bother to do so.  It is also considered poor form
to depend on this polite behavior in unrelated applications.

<h2>Resources allocation and contention</h2>

In some cases we need two (otherwise) unrelated resources to
get a task started, for example an in-bound and out-bound modem.
Starvation and live-lock/dead-lock are real posibilities in this
case.  To avoid such issues I use a few tactics:

<H3 id="pairs">Paired resource</H3>

When resources are almost always provided in pairs pool them in
pairs.  A line from a <code class="param">tag</code> file could
be a list of resources, and <code class="sh">xapply</code>'s
dicer mark-up can split those for you in a few characters.

<P>
In the rare case where you've "over allocated" by not using part
of the resources you allocated you have to ask yourself if that is
worth the risk of live-lock or the complexity of coding a lot more
structure to allocate exactly what you (think) you need now.

<h3 id="flock">Use <code class="sh">flock</code>(1)</h3>

A long time ago I coded a shell interface to the BSD
<code class="libc">flock</code>(2) system call.  When allocating
more than one resource you can start a <code class="sh">ksh</code>
co-process to hold a lock on a flag file that all consumers
use.  After you have the resources you terminate the co-process
and go on your way.  This prevents live-lock from allocation
order inversions in competing code.

<h3 id="limited">Allocate the most limited one first</h3>

If you know that one resource is more limited that another
always block on that one before you ask for the less limited one.
Processes do not spend time holding other resources locked while
blocking on the bottle-neck.

<h3 id="donot">Don't use <code class="sh">ptbw</code></h3>

For some resources it makes much more design-sense to limit
resource consumption in some other way.
For example band-width across network, disk, or the like might
be limited by <code class="sh">atlq</code>,
<code class="sh">rsync</code>'s <code class="opt">--bwlimit</code>
or by some other throttle.
In these cases <code class="sh">ptbw</code> might not be the
right tool to partition such a band-width class resource.


<h2>Use cases</h2>

While all the above is a pretty good stream of facts some readers
still might be wondering,
"How would I know I needed <code class="sh">ptbw</code>?"

<P>
When you have a list of tasks, and each task requires a "resource",
but the resources are general enough to do any single task you might
need <code class="sh">ptbw</code>.  You would need it to select a
resource to process an item from the list, not knowing the pairing
apriori.

<P>
Looking at it the other way; if I pair these numbers and letters:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >0	A
1	B
2	A
3	B
4	A
5	B</code></pre></blockquote>
Then I give that list of tasks to 2 worker threads, the first uses
"A" to process task "0", while the second uses "B" to process task 1.
When the one using "A" finishes it could start on "2", but what if the
one using "B" finishes first and trys to use resource "A" while task
"0" is still in process?

<P>
We would need to "hard partition" the list into "A-only" and "B-only",
thereby binding the resource to the thread, to keep double allocation
from breaking the process.  Such hard paritions limit the total
throughput of the system by holding one of the resources locked while
no process needs it (for example when A-only finishes, but B-only
still has many tasks to complete, we can't use "A" to work on any).

<h3>These sounds like <code class="sh">xapply</code></h3>

Because we are starting all the tasks in an explicit way, this sounds a
lot like a job for <a href="../xapply/xapply.html"><code class="sh">xapply</code></a>,
and it is.
<code class="sh">Ptbw</code> itself just manages the environment, some client
code must start the tasks with the payload (unit of work) bound to
the allocated resource, and
<code class="sh">xapply</code> knows all about that.

<p>
<code class="sh">Xapply</code> includes a built-in client for
the <code class="sh">ptbw</code> wrapper.
Under <code class="opt">-t</code> <code class="sh">xapply</code> figures out
if it needs to wrap itself in
an enclosing <code class="sh">ptwb</code> instance, or
just connect to an existing one based on
the type of the <code class="param">tags</code> parameter (file or socket).

<p>
<code class="sh">Xapply</code> knows how to make a client
connection to the enclosing <code class="sh">ptbw</code> instance to allocate
tokens for its many tasks.  It returns those tokens only as it
runs out of new tasks to start, it doesn't release tokens if it is
going to immediately issue again.  The current implementation
of <code class="sh">xapply</code> doesn't fetch additional tokens after the
initial allocation, so when others come available it won't
run a wider parallel factor: that's a missing feature.
<!-- And eventually I'll fix it. (ksb) -->

<P>
See the <A href="../xapply/xapply.html">xapply HTML</A> document for
examples of the <code class="sh">xapply</code> interface.
