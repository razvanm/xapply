<H1 id="known">What you need to know to understand this document</H1>

This document assumes you are quite familiar with the
standard UNIX tools from section 1
<code class="sh">date</code>,
<code class="sh">sed</code>,
<code class="sh">tr</code>,
<code class="sh">cat</code>,
and are very familiar with the shell itself,
that is <code class="sh">sh</code>(1).
<P>
In addition you need a working understanding of the common I/O
file descriptors, and how they are manipulated by the shell
(<code class="param">stdin</code>,
<code class="param">stdout</code>, <code class="param">stderr</code>).
And you should be able to quote parameter lists using double-quotes or
single-quotes -- and know when to use each.

<h1>What is <code class="sh">xclate</code>?</h1>

The <code class="sh">xclate</code> <a href="../wrapw/wrapper.html">wrapper</a>
collates multiple output streams such that the output from each task
is complete before any other's output begins.  This does <em>not</em> mean that
the program's execution is sequenced -- just the output.  The tasks may
run in parallel or even in reverse order, but the output is never mixed
together.

<p>
Intermingled results from multiple parallel processes create confusion.
For example the error output from "cat foo" and "make bar" mixed-up
might look like:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >make: cat: don't know how to make foo:  bar.  Stop
No such file or directory
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p id="need">
After working on large scale parallel processing for a time I
noticed that the main restriction I had left was the serialization
of output.  I had to write the output from all the processes to individual
files, then <code class="sh">cat</code> those to assemble a report
I could understand.  While all that was going on I couldn't even examine
the output from the finished tasks.

<P>
I decided to code a solution that would show me the output from the
finished tasks as soon as they terminated.  The best way I knew how
to do it was with a wrapper.

<H2 id="tactic">Building the wrapper</H2>

Briefly a wrapper is a two-part program: a part that holds a socket
open to service clients, and a part that services clients.  The difference
between this and a typical "client/server" model is that there are usually
many "servers" running on a host for different logins, programs, and
functions all at the same time -- and there may by many clients connecting
to each of those in parallel.

<P>
The through-put provided to one instance is not bound in any way to the
actions of another (given sufficent resources).  For example peer wrappers
to not share the same <code class="libc">listen</code>(2) queue, or the
even the same socket options or accept filters.
This reduces one bottle-neck in the
client/server model, and removes some of the need for "well known ports".

<P>
To speed the implementation more we use local-domain (unix-domain) sockets.
This removes the overhead of TCP/IP for communications, making inter-process
comunications exactly as fast as a pipe.

<P><!-- I had another idea... ZZZ ??? -->

<H2>Using the wrapper</H2>

The master instance of the wrapper and the client mode are almost always the
same program, and <code class="sh">xclate</code> is no exception.
Selecte the master instance with the <code class="opt">-m</code> option,
the client mode is the default case.

<P>
The usage for a master instance of <code class="sh">xclate</code> is:
<blockquote>
xclate
<code class="opt">-m</code>
[<code class="opt">-dQrsv</code>]
[<code class="param">-depth</code>]
[<code class="opt">-H</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">hr</code>]
[<code class="opt">-i</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">input</code>]
[<code class="opt">-L</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">cap</code>]
[<code class="opt">-N</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">notify</code>]
[<code class="opt">-O</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">output</code>]
[<code class="opt">-T</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">title</code>]
[<code class="opt">-u</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">unix</code>]
[<code class="opt">-W</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">widow</code>]
[<code class="param">utility</code>]
</blockquote>
<P>
That shows that the command "<code class="sh">xclate -m</code>" is a
legal invokation of the program, and it is.  When you run that command
a new shell is created which has access to the new master process's
resources.  Here is an example showing the shell history number
resets to 1 for the new shell, the process tree and the socket
that that instance opened (which I found with the version output
from <code class="sh">xclate</code>):
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >wrkstn /home/ksb 85  xclate -m
wrkstn /home/ksb 1  ptree $$
117   /usr/sbin/sshd
  8758  sshd: ksb@ttyp2
    8761  -ksh
      99919 xclate -m
        99920 ksh
          99984 ptree 99920

wrkstn /home/ksb 2  xclate -V
xclate: $<!-- -->Id: xclate.m,v 2.53 2008/09/11 17:55:36 ksb ...

wrkstn /home/ksb 4  exit
wrkstn /home/sac1/ksb 86  ...
</code></pre></blockquote>

<P>
While an interactive shell is a possible <code class="param">utility</code>,
it is probably not the best choice.
It a lot easier to use in a script, and an interactive shell doesn't
usually require the services on an <code class="sh">xclate</code>
master instance.
Usually the structure built for an <code class="sh">xclate</code> master
instance is a script or a tool that knows about <code class="sh">xclate</code>.

<P>
But we will come back to the shell example to show some of
the features off later.
For the time being we need to know how to start a client program.
The options for a client instance look like:
<blockquote>
xclate
[<code class="opt">-Qsvw</code>]
[<code class="opt">-IEDY</code>]
[<code class="opt">-depth</code>]
[<code class="opt">-H</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">hr</code>]
[<code class="opt">-L</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">cap</code>]
[<code class="opt">-T</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">title</code>]
[<code class="opt">-u</code>&nbsp;<code class="param">unix</code>]
[<code class="param">xid</code>]
[<code class="param">client</code>]
</blockquote>

<P>
There are 3 important points in this option specification:
<DL>
<DT>[<code class="param">xid</code>] [<code class="param">client</code>]
<DD>
Each client specifies two positional parameters: the <code class="param">xid</code> name and the <code class="param">client</code> process.
It is all too common the forget the <code class="param">xid</code>, I
do it all the time.
<DT><em>it is not shown that master instance must enclose a client instance</em>
<DD>
A master instance must enclose a client instance, like any other wrapper.
But unlike other wrappers the primary use-case is via
<code class="sh">xapply</code>
which knows how to create both the master instance and the client
instances, see the
<A href="../xapply/xapply.html">xapply HTML document</A>.
<DT>[<code class="opt">-Qsvw</code>] [<code class="opt">-IEDY</code>]
<DD>
There are 2 different bundles of single letter switches.  This is
meant to indicate that the second switches turn on other features
inside the program, and may subtley change the behavior of the client.
In effect providing any of <code class="opt">-I</code>,
<code class="opt">-E</code>, <code class="opt">-D</code>, or
<code class="opt">-Y</code> implies a major change in how
<code class="sh">xclate</code> processes the client request.
</DL>

<p>
It would be a lot of typing, but one could collate output with
<code class="sh">xclate</code> from a command prompt.
It is <em>much</em> more likely to be part of a shell script, or even
designed into a large-scale parallel application.
That's why it is
an integral part of <code class="sh">xapply</code> and
<code class="sh">hxmd</code>, see the
<A href="../../sbin/hxmd/hxmd.html">hxmd HTML document</A>.

<H2 id="useful">How useful is that?</H2>

All this talk about collated output doesn't look like a
super feature by itself.  To see where this would
be helpful think about a large process tree, with many
parallel workers, all of which might want access to a single
output-stream.  For this example let's say the
output goes to a interactive <code class="sh">less</code>.

<p>
How would we present the output to the reader?  Which task
should output first (first started or first finished)?
How shall we label the output "parts" so they will be  recognizable
<em>sections</em> for the reader.
We'd might also like to handle nested groupings (as chapters
in a book, with sections in chapters, or even paragraphs in those sections).

<p>
Output which is not properly directed to a collated sections should
be diverted to the end, or trapped someplace.  And it would be pretty
neat if we could keep a running tally of the sections still open, or
finished.

<p>
<code class="sh">Xclate</code> provides those features, and a few more.

<H2 id="integrate">Integration with ksb tools</H2>

Since I coded <code class="sh">xclate</code> it stands to reason that
I'd use it.  Oh, and I <em>do</em>!

<H3>With <code class="sh">xapply</code></H3>
The key application that use this is
<A href="/cgi-bin/manpage.cgi?xapply"><code class="sh">xapply</code></A>,
which drives many parallel tasks, and
might want the output from each task to be continuous.
Another example would be a "make world" on a FreeBSD host.  If we could
put a "|xclate $component" on the end of each major component we could
make the output of the build a <strong>lot</strong> easier to read, while
making it much more parallel.

<p>
In fact <code class="sh">xclate</code> must be installed before
<code class="sh">xapply</code> is built.
On a related note,
<A href="../../sbin/hxmd/hxmd.html"><code class="sh">hxmd</code></A>
uses options to <code class="sh">xclate</code> directly, so it won't run without
<code class="sh">xclate</code> either.

<p>
The shell fragment below starts a collated stream over an
<code class="sh">xapply</code> with 3 tasks in parallel.
Each task stalls a bit between the output of a sequence of lines,
for a total of about 6 seconds (1+2+1+2+0).  We ask for
9 iterations ('first' ... 'last').
That makes the whole <code class="sh">xapply</code> command take
about 18 seconds (9*6 / 3),
but the output <strong>is not intermixed</strong>.
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >$ time xclate -m xapply -P3 'for i in 1 2 1 2 0 ; \
	 do date +"%1 %%c"; sleep $i; done |xclate %1' \
		first t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 last
... (output of the data line) ...
   19.09s real     0.25s user     0.46s system
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
The extra second overhead is the time for <code class="sh">xapply</code> to
fork all the processes and build all the pipes,
and also a small constant term due to code that compensates for
a race condition in a <code class="libc">select</code>(2) loop.

<p>
A shorthand for this is:
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >$ time xapply <em class="new">-m</em> -P3 'for i in 1 2 1 2 0 ; \
	do date +"%1 %%c"; sleep $i; done' \
		first t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 last
...
   19.08s real     0.21s user     0.48s system
</code></pre></blockquote>
which almost completely hides the xclate usage from the script writer.
That code is what makes <code class="sh">xapply</code> a wrapper: it
wraps itself automatically in an <code class="sh">xclate</code>.

<p>
That shorthand does limit the command-line options which can be
passed directly to <code class="sh">xclate</code>.
For example to pass the '-T "start %x"'
option to the xclate-filter we must leverage an environment variable,
like this (see the
<A href="/cgi-bin/manpage.cgi?xclate"><code class="sh">xclate manual page</code></A>
under ENVIRONMENT):
<blockquote class="file"><pre><code >$ XCLATE_1='-T "start %x"' ; export XCLATE_1
$ time xapply <i>...</i>
</code></pre></blockquote>

<H3>With <code class="sh">hxmd</code> and <code class="sh">msrc</code></H3>

Since <code class="sh">hxmd</code> uses <code class="sh">xapply</code> and always passes the
<code class="opt">-m</code> switch down it also uses <code class="sh">xclate</code>.  The
collated stream under <code class="sh">hxmd</code> is <em>really useful</em>, as
<code class="sh">hxmd</code> output without collation is extremely jumbled.

<p>
This is such a benefit that there is no command-line option to
turn off the use of xclate.  Now think about how much I like command-line
options and wonder "What's gotten into him?"

<p>
The <code class="sh">msrc</code> remote build tool uses
<code class="sh">hxmd</code> to build the wrapper machine it needs, so
it uses <code class="sh">xclate</code> in
exactly the same way as <code class="sh">hxmd</code>.

<H3>With <code class="sh">ptbw</code></H3>

The parallel token broker (<code class="sh">ptbw</code>) is used to limit the
number of parallel tasks inside a collated stream, but not really used
to produce collated output.
But it has a subtle link to <code class="sh">xclate</code>, none the less.

<p>
Any <code class="sh">ptbw</code> instance nests its UNIX domain communications
socket inside the tightest enclosing <code class="sh">xclate</code> directory.
This is an attempt to reduce the load on the filesystem be reducing
the number of meta updates for the creation and deletion of temporary
directories.  Also see the <A href="../ptbw/ptbw.html">ptbw HTML document</A>.

<h3>With <code class="sh">distrib</code></h3>

Quite often calls to <code class="sh">distrib</code> were wrapped in an
<code class="sh">xapply -m</code>, which is
where <code class="sh">hxmd</code> came from.

<p>
<code class="sh">Hxmd</code> builds the whole <code class="sh">xapply</code>
stack with detailed knowledge and intent.  It does a better job of constructing
the stack than any shell programmed could by creating pipes that the
shell cannot (easily) express.  Well, <code class="sh">ksh</code> can
with a co-process.
